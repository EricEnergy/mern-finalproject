## Objective

This application is intended as a tool for small business owners in the services industry to connect with potential customers.

By creating an account in the app, the business owners are able to create their own company profile page which will display their company info and images of their previous work for potential customers to browse thru.

Potential customers have the option to setup an appointment by providing their contact information which is made available to the business owners and gets added to the appointments section in their profile page.

## How to use this App

### As a Potential Client

To browse thru the different companies offering services you will use the sidebar menu located on the left side of the homepage.

Initially, the sidebar will display the different service categories. Once you click on the desired category, a list of all the available companies within such category will populate. Click on any of the company names to show their information.

The selected company's information will be displayed in the main area of the page. On the top you will be able to see the company's summary information such as place of business and description. The bottom area of the page is where you will be able to browse thru different images of their previous work.

If you decide to setup an appointment with any of the companies, you're able to do so by clicking on the "appointment" button located on the right side of the page. Once you click on the button, a form will pop up where you can select the date and time for your appointment. Once you have entered the requested information, click "ok" to send the appointment to the company.

### As a Business Owner

In order for you to use this app as a business owner, you will need to create a company account. You can do this by clicking on the "Sign" button located on the top right corner of the homepage. Once you click on the button, you will be redirected to the sign in/sign up page.

At the sign in/sign up page, you will need to provide the following information:

    - Company Name
    - Email Address
    - Password (6 characters or longer)
    - Service Category
    - Company Description

If all the information submitted is valid you will receive a notification at the bottom of the page indicating that your account has been created successfully. Once your account is created, you may log in by using your email address and password on the right side of the page.

After signing in, you will be redirected to your profile page.

Your profile page will display your company information on the top section, followed by your Appointments section and your saved posts. In the saved posts section, the top left card is where you will be able to add a new post.

To save a new post to your profile page, click on the small "camera" icon in the top left image card within your posts section. Once you click the button, a new form will pop up where you will add the image file or the image url. Once you click "save" the post will automatically appear on your profile page.
